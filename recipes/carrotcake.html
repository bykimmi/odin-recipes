    <ul>
        <li>4 cups Powdered Sugar (480g)</li>
        <li>½ cup Vegan Butter (112g)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
        <li>2-3 Tbsp Fresh Lemon Juice</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Walnuts Chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4> 
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spray two 7-inch cake pans or two 8-inch cake pans (see notes*) with non-stick spray and line the bottoms with circles of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sift the all purpose flour into a mixing bowl and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix together.</li>
        <li>Add the light brown sugar and grated carrot to the mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Prepare your flax eggs by adding 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed meal to a bowl with 6 tablespoons of hot water. Let it sit for a minute to become gloopy.</li>
        <li>Add the flax eggs, oil, vanilla extract, apple cider vinegar and chopped walnuts to the mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together. If it seems like it won't come together and the mix is too dry then step away from the bowl for a couple of minutes and then come back to it. The carrots will have released more moisture into the batter allowing it to come together into a thick batter.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare your frosting.</li>
        <li>Add the powdered sugar, vegan butter, vanilla extract, apple cider vinegar and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the bowl of your stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Start mixing on low speed gradually increasing speed until your frosting is thick and smooth.</li>
        <li>If your frosting is too thick then add in the extra tablespoon of lemon juice, a drop at a time and only as much as needed to get to a spreadable consistency.</li>
        <li>Frost the cake and decorate the top with chopped walnuts.</li>
    </ol>
